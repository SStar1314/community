# Contributing to the community repo

Make a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) (PR).

Upon successful review, someone will give the PR
a __LGTM__ (_looks good to me_) in the review thread.

A [SIG lead](sig-list.md) (or someone with approval powers
as specified in an OWNERS file) may merge the PR immediately
with or without an LGTM from someone else.
Or they may wait a business day to get further feedback from other reviewers.

Edits in SIG sub-directories should follow any additional guidelines described
by the respective SIG leads in the sub-directory's `CONTRIBUTING` file
(e.g. [sig-cli/CONTRIBUTING](sig-cli/CONTRIBUTING.md)).
